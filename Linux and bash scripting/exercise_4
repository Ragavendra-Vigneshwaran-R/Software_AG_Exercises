# Question 4 : Increase the swapsize by adding new swap storage

# create a file that will be used for swap
dd if=/dev/zero of=/swap_file count=1 bs=1M

# secure the swap file 
chmod 600 /swap_file

# for setting up the file as Linux swap area use mkswap command
sudo mkswap /swap_file

# enable the swap using swapon command:
sudo swapon /swap_file

# for verifing that the swap is active, use free command
free -h
